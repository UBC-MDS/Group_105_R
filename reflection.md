# __Reflection - Milestone 4__  
December 14, 2019  

## __Team Critique__  

---

We are quite happy with the result of our R dashboard given the short development and implementation time. We were able to effectively convert the Python dashboard to R even though there were some functionality limitiations in dash R. We were able to integrate the maintenance features implemented in milestone 3 to the working version of the R dashboard - a definite success. However, there is still room for improving the R dashboard as the focus of the current submission was to convert the python dashboard and not implement new features. 

Luckily there are no apparent bugs with the app, all the features and interactivity appear to function as expected - however, user/peer review is required. A few aesthetic changes would be ideal: better alignment of the title block, a background colour for the entire page, and better scaling of the figures across different screen sizes. With respect to the plotly tooltips/toolbars, there appears to be some inherent bug that doesn't filter out the removed tooltips from the deployed app - this is an issue that should be addresed by the dash R developers. Finally, code optimization is required to make it more interpretable and reproducable. Generally, we need to optimize the user exploratory analysis experience. 

Overall, our general sentiment regarding the app remains the same as before, the plots are simple and intuitive to navigate and read, and the interactivity does not overwhelm or confound the user; the use of tabs to separate the plots helps in distinguishing the research questions.


## __Feedback from TA's and Peers__  

---

No feedback was received from the TA's or peers for the R app. However, as noted above, we were able to incorporate the maintenance features implemeneted for milestone 3 (python app critiques) into the R dashboard. Please refer to the [milestone 3 reflection](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Group_105/blob/master/reflection.md) for a detailed list of maintenance items and addressed optimizations. To avoid repetition, refer to the milestone 3 reflection for ___addressed___ and ___outstanding___ app features. It is important to stress, the R dashboard needs to be reflected and imporved upon in the context of the principles of creating effective dashboards - likely the next step in development.
